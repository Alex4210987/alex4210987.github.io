Oppenheimer is a masterpiece of biographical film.

I personally don't really appreciate this movie. If I watch it at home, I would probably fall asleep or quit watching it. But it's surely a interesting movie worthy of a review.

## Nolanic

Nolan is no doubt a master of film-making, and the film is very Nolanic. The movie is shot in 70mm IMAX, which is the same as Interstellar and Tenet. There are many shots of space and bomb explosion -- and many of them are not generated with CG. Those are dreamy fantastic scenes.

So is the sound effects. The stomping noise echoing 

The movie inherits 2 focuses of Nolan's previous works: 1st is his interest in science and tech, which is demosntrated in Interstellar, Inception, Tenet, etc; 2nd is his interest in war, which is demonstrated in Dunkirk, and to some extent, The Dark Knight Rises.
