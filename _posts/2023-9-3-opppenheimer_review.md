*Oppenheimer* is a masterpiece of biographical film.

I personally don't really appreciate this movie. If I watch it at home, I would probably fall asleep or quit watching it. But it's surely a interesting movie worthy of a review.

## Nolanic

Nolan is no doubt a master of film-making, and the film is very Nolanic. The movie is shot in 70mm IMAX, which is the same as Interstellar and Tenet. There are many shots of space and bomb explosion -- and many of them are not generated with CG. Those are dreamy and fantastic scenes.

Sound effects and editing are also brilliant. The stomping noise echoing in Oppenheimer's mind, and the demostration of the realistic sounds after the *trinity* nuclear test, and the smooth insertion of classical music and soundtrack into the plot, are all work of a master.

Of all this, the topic it talks about make it a typical Nolan movie.

The movie inherits 2 focuses from Nolan's previous works: 1st is his interest in science and tech, which is demosntrated in Interstellar, Inception, Tenet, etc; 2nd is his interest in war, which is demonstrated in Dunkirk, and to some extent, The Dark Knight Rises.

## The Hero

The movie is about J.R. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, especially his life leading the *Manhattan* Project and a hearing about his security clearance.

The movie is not a biography, but a hero story. It's about how a hero is made, and how a hero is destroyed.[^1]

[^1]: The sentence is generated with copilot, but somehow appropriate. So it's kept here.

The 1st act, called *fisson* uses Oppenheimer's memory, while the 2nd act, called *fusion* uses those of one admiral Strauss, who led the hearing and considered Oppenheimer a personal enemy.

The editing blended the 2 acts together, and the acts are basically in chronological order. The 1st is photographed in color, while the 2nd is in black and white. I guess this is a metaphor: Oppenheimer's life is colorful, while Strauss's is black and white.

First half of Oppenheimer's life is certainly coloful and romantic -- the birth of a hero.

We traveled through Oxford, GÃ¶ttingen, Leiden and Berkeley, and met many famous scientists, including Max Born, Paul Dirac, Niels Bohr, and Enrico Fermi. We also met Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, and his mistress, Jean Tatlock.

Finally, we arrived at Los Alamos, where Oppenheimer led the *Manhattan* Project. It is the paradise for him, where he *combined physics and New Mexico*.

Despite setbacks in love life, political participation, and science endeavor, Oppenheimer marched on, and finally his fame reached its peak after the *trinity* nuclear test.

A line especially impressed me: Math is like read sheet music, but physics needs one to hear the music. It is inspiring for Oppenheimer, and also for me, who is poor at math. :)

The movie would have ended here, as an ode to American heroism, if it's not a Nolan movie. 

## The Matyr

Gloomy clouds always hovers over Oppenheimer's head during his life. 

In Europe, he once attempted to poison his tutor because of depression.('*you just need to get laid*', as his mistress commented later) He also felt unwelcomed as a Jew.

Back to the states, he get into some troubles for his left-wing political views, as well as his inresponsible attitude towards love.
