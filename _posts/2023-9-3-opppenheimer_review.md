Christopher Nolan's latest work, Oppenheimer, is a masterpiece of biographical film.

I personally don't really appreciate this movie. If I watch it at home, I would probably fall asleep or quit watching it. But it's surely a interesting movie worthy of a review.

# Nolanic
The filming style is very Nolanic. The movie is shot in 70mm IMAX, which is the same as Interstellar and Tenet.

The movie inherits 2 focuses of Nolan's previous works: 1st is his interest in science and tech, which is demosntrated in Interstellar, Inception, Tenet, etc; 2nd is his interest in war, which is demonstrated in Dunkirk, and to some extent, The Dark Knight Rises.
