*Oppenheimer* is a masterpiece of biographical film.

I personally don't really appreciate this movie. If I watch it at home, I would probably fall asleep or quit watching it. But it's surely a interesting movie worthy of a review.

## Nolanic

Nolan is no doubt a master of film-making, and the film is very Nolanic. The movie is shot in 70mm IMAX, which is the same as Interstellar and Tenet. There are many shots of space and bomb explosion -- and many of them are not generated with CG. Those are dreamy and fantastic scenes.

Sound effects and editing are also brilliant. The stomping noise echoing in Oppenheimer's mind, and the demostration of the realistic sounds after the *trinity* nuclear test, and the smooth insertion of classical music and soundtrack into the plot, are all work of a master.

Of all this, the topic it talks about make it a typical Nolan movie.

The movie inherits 2 focuses from Nolan's previous works: 1st is his interest in science and tech, which is demosntrated in Interstellar, Inception, Tenet, etc; 2nd is his interest in war, which is demonstrated in Dunkirk, and to some extent, The Dark Knight Rises.

## Hero

The movie is about J.R. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, especially his life leading the *Manhattan* Project and a hearing about his security clearance.
