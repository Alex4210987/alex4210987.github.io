this is the first day of the year. i'm gonna write something, something fictional, to deal with my loneliness, vanity and self-pity.

it is titled 2024. so let's assume it happens in 2024.

# how the year begins

maybe i worry too much. it's all about my self-esteem i guess... i can't accept myself being moderate, especially on fields i treasure.

let's end the digression. David was singing *Butterfly* on the gala. and then my phone rang. it was my friend back from senior high. she had been playing poker with a couple, and they were going to my university, where the boyfriend of the couple was studying. she asked me to go there. it's a bit late, but i agreed. i was bored anyway, and i haven't seen her in a long time.
