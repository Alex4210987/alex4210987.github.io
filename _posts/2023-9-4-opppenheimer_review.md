*Oppenheimer* is a biographical masterpiece that delves into the life of J.R. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. While personally, I may not connect deeply with this film, I recognize its significance and believe it merits discussion.

## Nolanic

Directed by Christopher Nolan, *Oppenheimer* unmistakably bears the mark of his distinctive filmmaking style. Shot in 70mm IMAX, the film shares the grandeur of *Interstellar* and *Tenet*, featuring breathtaking scenes of space and bomb explosionsâ€”many achieved without CGI, creating a dreamy and immersive atmosphere.

The film's sound effects and editing are nothing short of brilliant. From the haunting echoes of stomping in Oppenheimer's mind to the realistic sounds following the *Trinity* nuclear test, and the seamless integration of classical music and the soundtrack into the narrative, it is evident that a master is at work.

Beyond its technical prowess, the film traverses familiar Nolan territory, exploring two recurring themes from his previous works: a fascination with science and technology, exemplified in *Interstellar*, *Inception*, and *Tenet*, and an exploration of war, as witnessed in *Dunkirk* and, to some extent, *The Dark Knight Rises*.
